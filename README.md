## About the style

Publication layout design style is based on CSS Template from Interpunct – full stack graphic design, [Interpunct.dev](https://interpunct.dev/). GNU General Public License ([GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)).

### Fonts

Fonts for this style are Arial system fonts.

### Translations

The style has been set in English. Currently this mean two document labels are hard coded. These are:

   - Table of Contents
   - Page (Page number labels)

To change these to _Inhaltsverzeichnis_ and _Blatt_, for exmaple in Germna, these need to change in the CSS and a separate style made for that language.
